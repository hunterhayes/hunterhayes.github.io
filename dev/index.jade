      h2 What to Wear
      p The wedding dress code is semi-formal attire. Weather permitting, most of the wedding day events will take place outside; the Clifton Inn is a large property with uneven, grassy grounds and gravel paths, so you may want to keep that in mind when selecting shoes (for what it's worth, the bride intends to wear flats). Additionally, early autumn is typically warm in Charlottesville, but it can get chilly at night.

      p A few of our non-Indian guests have asked about wearing Indian clothes to the wedding. It is definitely welcome but certainly not required - we encourage guests to wear the clothing style they're going to have the most fun in! For those interested in wearing Indian attire, here are a few sites to consider for purchase and rental options:
