      <h2>What to Wear</h2>
      <p>The wedding dress code is semi-formal attire. Weather permitting, most of the wedding day events will take place outside; the Clifton Inn is a large property with uneven, grassy grounds and gravel paths, so you may want to keep that in mind when selecting shoes (for what it's worth, the bride intends to wear flats). Additionally, early autumn is typically warm in Charlottesville, but it can get chilly at night.</p>
      <div class="imgZoom right abha"><img src="/images/wearAbha.jpg" class="alt"></div>
      <p>A few of our non-Indian guests have asked about wearing Indian clothes to the wedding. It is definitely welcome but certainly not required - we encourage guests to wear the clothing style they're going to have the most fun in! For those interested in wearing Indian attire, here are a few sites to consider for purchase and rental options:</p>

      <h2>Sights to See</h2>
      <p>Although Charlottesville is a small town, it has a lot going on. <a href="http://www.monticello.org">Monitcello</a> is the most famous attraction, but the town and surrounding area offer many other activities as well - hiking, touring wineries and breweries, exploring the historic University of Virginia campus, or strolling along the downtown pedestrian mall.

      <p>Some personal favorites on the winery and brewery front include <a href="http://www.bbvwine.com">Barboursville Vineyards</a>, <a href="http://www.starrhill.com">Starr Hill Brewery</a>, <a href="http://www.castlehillcider.com">Castle Hill Cider</a> and <a href="http://www.albemarleciderworks.com">Albemarle CiderWorks</a>. As for restaurants, there are a number of great choices in town, but we really enjoy <a href="http://www.mastapas.com">Mas Tapas</a> and <a href="http://oakhartsocial.com">Oakhart Social</a>.</p>
